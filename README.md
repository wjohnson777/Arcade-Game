# Classic Arcade Game Clone

This is a clone of the retro Frogger game

## Instructions

The main objective is to move your player across the game board using the arrow keys on the keyboard.

Avoid the enemy bugs to get to the water and score.

If your hit by an enemy bug the score resets back to '0' and your player is set back to the beginning.

Once you score '5' points you win the game!
